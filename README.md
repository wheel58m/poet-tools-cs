This is a C# program that helps users find rhyming words for a given input word. The program uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary to identify the rhyming syllables for the input word, and then finds all the words in the dictionary that share the same rhyming syllables.

## Issues

-   The program only finds traditional rhymes (ending sounds) but does not identify complex rhyming schemes like unconventional rhymes, internal rhymes, or phrase rhymes.

## Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in your C# IDE of choice.
3.  Build and run the program.
4.  When prompted, enter the word you want to find a rhyme for.
5.  The program will display a list of all the words in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary that share that same rhyming syllables.

## Future Improvements

-   ~~Display the top 10 best rhyming words (words with the most rhyming syllables).~~
-   ~~Create a Continue Method to allow a user to view the next 10 rhymes.~~
-   Create a 'Syllable Counter' method to display the number of syllables in a given word.
-   Create a 'Word Counter' method to count the number of words in a line.
-   Create a 'Get Poem Template' method to generate and display templates for different poem types (Sonnets, Haikus, Limerick, etc.).
-   Create a 'Define Word' method to return the definition of a given word.
-   Create a 'Display Pronunciation' Method to print the phonetic guide for a given word.
