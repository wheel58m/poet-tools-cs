This is a C# program that provides tools to help users write poetry. The program uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary to identify rhyming words or load the pronunciation guide for any given word.

## Issues

-   FindRhyme Method does not display a message if the input word is not found in the dictionary.
-   FindRhyme Method does not display a message if there are no rhymes for the input word.
-   The program only finds traditional rhymes (ending sounds) but does not identify complex rhyming schemes like unconventional rhymes, internal rhymes, or phrase rhymes.

## Instructions & Usage
To use this program, build and run the program in your C# IDE of choice. From there a menu will load, input the number corresponding to the tool you would like to use. Currently there are two tools available.

1.  Find Rhyming Words Tool: Allows you to enter a word and find other words with similar sound patterns.
2.  Display Pronunciation Tool: Loads the sound pattern of a given word.

## Future Improvements

-   Create a 'Syllable Counter' method to display the number of syllables in a given word.
-   Create a 'Word Counter' method to count the number of words in a line.
-   Create a 'Get Poem Template' method to generate and display templates for different poem types (Sonnets, Haikus, Limerick, etc.).
-   Create a 'Define Word' method to return the definition of a given word.
-   ~~Create a 'Display Pronunciation' Method to print the phonetic guide for a given word.~~
